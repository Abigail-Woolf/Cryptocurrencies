# Crytocurrencies
Unsupervised Learning
In this repository, I used unsupervised learning techniques to create an analysis clients looking to get into the cryptocurrency market.
With the cryptocurrency data I was given, data transformation was necessary to fit the machine learning models. To do this, I prepare the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means. Once that was accomplished, I had to reduce the data dimensions using PCA algorithms from sklearn. This allowed me to predict clusters using the cryptocurrency data via the K-means algorithm from sklearn. Finally, I created a 3D scatter plot to vusualize the clusters and a 2D scatter plot to present my results. 


## updates
there is no known output
used to discover patterns or groups in data
input data only and no knoeringf and K-mean algorithm

wn output

we will process the data
then group it together using clustering and k means algorithm (the main unsupervised algorithm that groups imilar data into clusters. We will speed up the process by using PCA which employs many different features

then we will use principle component analysis

discover trends to invest in new cryptocurrency
key difference from supervised ML - there are no paried inputs and outcomes and the model uses a whoel dataset as input
unsupervised learning is used in one of two ways: tranform the data to create an intuitive representationfor analysis or to use in another ML model
or Cluster or determon patterns ina grouping of data, rather than to predict a classification
### transformations or clustering?
transofrmations - when we need to take raw data and make it easier to understand or so it can be used in other ML algorithms by reducing its dimensional representation.
Clustering - to group similar objects into clusters

hvPlot, Plotly, Scikit-learn

## Preprocessing data
Deal with unnecessaru columns, rows with null values and mixed data types (data selesction, data processing, data transformation)
scale the data - ensures that the variance between the numbers won't skew the results

inertia is one of the most common objective functions to use when creating an elbow curve. it measures the amount of variation in the dataset.
