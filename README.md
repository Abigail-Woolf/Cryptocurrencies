# Crytocurrencies
Unsupervised Learning
In this repository, I used unsupervised learning techniques to create an analysis clients looking to get into the cryptocurrency market.
With the cryptocurrency data I was given, data transformation was necessary to fit the machine learning models. To do this, I prepare the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means. Once that was accomplished, I had to reduce the data dimensions using PCA algorithms from sklearn. This allowed me to predict clusters using the cryptocurrency data via the K-means algorithm from sklearn. Finally, I created a 3D scatter plot to vusualize the clusters and a 2D scatter plot to present my results.
